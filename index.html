            <p>This exciting course blends the study of human biology with the rigorous techniques used in forensic laboratories, including analysis of blood, fibres, fingerprints, drugs, documents, DNA and fire/explosives residue. Ideal if you are fascinated by the scientific investigation of crime.</p>
            <p>We adopt a ‘Crime Scene to Court’ approach to their teaching, which really helps you to understand forensics, in particular the need to methodically collect samples, analyse them and present the results to the standard required by the courts.</p>
            <p>You can also engage in multiple placement opportunities, the chance to conduct research alongside our experienced staff or the many professional organisations we have links with – such as Leicester Royal Infirmary, Key Forensic Services Ltd, Nemaura Pharmaceuticals Ltd and West Midlands Police.</p>
            <h3>Why choose this course?</h3>
            <p>If you are fascinated with human biology and the scientific investigation of crime, our degree will enable you to learn all about human physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology/genetics, microbiology and how each of these disciplines can be applied in forensic science.</p>
            <p>You’ll be based in our new state-of-the-art £37 million Science and Health Building, which provides an outstanding learning and research environment, which features a video-linked ‘crime scene’ house, outstanding analytical laboratory facilities and the largest Class II containment teaching laboratory in Europe, specifically designed to accommodate microbiology, cell culture, molecular biology/genetics, biochemistry and forensic science.</p>
            <p>You’ll be taught by our experienced staff, many of whom bring professional or research expertise to their teaching. They have held roles as quality assurance managers in major pharmaceuticals companies, such as GSK and British Biotech, as forensic scientists in the Forensic Science Service or as analytical scientists in government laboratories. They continue to provide consultancy and expert commentary in areas of safety and efficacy testing for the BBC, most recently on illegal skin bleaching products on sale in the UK.</p>
            <p>Coventry has an excellent reputation for evidence-based scientific research; our faculty possess expertise and have published in biochemistry, cell biology, genomic and molecular biology, microbiology, pharmacology and physiology. In your final year, you have the opportunity to collaborate on a research project, which in the past has led to students winning prizes at the Forensic Institute Research Network (FIRN) Midlands regional conference, attend the international Forensic Research and Teaching (FORREST) conference and publish articles in academic journals.</p>
            <p>Throughout your studies, you will find that the course is underpinned with practical experience. Laboratory sessions will help to develop the practical skills needed for a career in a variety of biology and forensic roles. You will learn key experimental techniques and develop essential experimental, data handling, reporting and broader scientific skills, such as literature researching, information technology, bioinformatics, data processing and the use of statistics.</p>
            <p>You’ll have the opportunity to undertake short and long-term placements. Previously students have worked on revolutionary technologies for Cambridge Scientific Solutions, such as the removal of biofilm formations which foul beer lines in pubs, or the formulation of drug products for transdermal patch applications for Nemaura Pharmaceuticals.</p>
            <p>In your final year, we tackle a simulated investigation to solve a ‘real-world’ problem, which involves the p</li>roduction of an expert witness statement and culminates in the presentation of evidence in a mock courtroom scenario. You could find yourself being called upon to establish whether the glass found on a suspect’s jumper indicates that he was implicated in smashing a window at an alleged burglary scene or whether blood found on </li>he broken window matches the DNA profile of the suspect’s blood.  Other scenarios include an assessment of w</li>hether the paint found on a suspect’s keys matches the paint from a damaged vehicle and an assessment of</li> the significance of this match.</p>

            <p>If you are interested in working in the fields of human bioscience or its application to forensic science, this course will prepare you to design, implement and evaluate appropriate investigative techniques. It has been purposefully designed to give you a thorough understanding of both modern human bioscience topics and their application to forensic science. You will cover key study and research skills in the areas of forensic science, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, microbiology and human physiology.</p>
            <p>Many areas of human bioscience, such as the development of new antimicrobials or the manipulation of stem cells to treat inherited conditions, require graduates with good theoretical and practical knowledge alongside the skills to control, implement and evaluate these new developments. This is a varied, applied course, which recognises the multidisciplinary approach that is needed in modern sciences. Throughout your degree, you will study the details of forensic science, the legal system and investigative practice, demonstrating a capability to maintain auditable records of your investigations.</p>
            <p>The first year modules will introduce you to basic scientific principles, such as hypotheses development and testing, laboratory procedures and protocols, health and safety and data presentation and analysis across the range of bioscience disciplines studied. The essential bioscience principles begin from the molecular level building up to cellular processes and extending to organism physiology systems.</p>
            <p>This process is continued throughout the second year where we develop your awareness of the structure and function of key biochemical molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, enzymes and carbohydrates. You will also study the biology of cells – creation, differentiation and death; intra and inter cellular communication pathways; protein production and delivery and tissue integration.</p>
            <p>As the course progresses, you have the choice to follow themes of either human physiology or microbiology. You can develop your interest in human physiology – studying whole body systems such as cardio-pulmonary, respiratory, reproductive, neurological and/or renal systems – or follow a more microbiological route, by studying prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, viruses, phagocytes, immune responses and epidemiology. In your final year, you can continue the microbiology specialisation by extending the second year module ‘Infection and Immunity’ to the third year module ‘Medical Microbiology’. For human physiology, you would extend the second year specialist module ‘Systemic Physiology’ to the third year module ‘Clinical Physiology’.</p>
            <p>You can further customise your degree by selecting either the ‘Cancer Biology’ module or the ‘Applied Human Genetics’ module.</p>
            <p>Your main study themes are:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Human Biology</strong>: Biology related to human beings, covering the disciplines of human: physiology, microbiology, molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, immunology and oncology.</li>
              <li><strong>Forensic Science</strong>: Crime scene protocols for recovery, physical, biological and chemical techniques for analysis, statistical interpretation and legal aspects governing presentation of evidence for the criminal justice system.</li>
              <li><strong>Laboratory Competence</strong>: Generic and specialised skills in experimental biology, including experimentation and measurements on humans, anti-contamination and audit trail procedures, safety (eg. key laboratory skills and competencies, good laboratory practice) and ethical considerations.</li>
              <li><strong>Research Methods</strong>: Critical analysis, reflection, information searching and experimental design in the biological sciences. Data collection, analysis and presentation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>On completion, you will be able to:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Demonstrate understanding and knowledge of the theoretical, analytical and practical aspects and clinical applications of human physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, genetics, forensic science and analytical science.</li>
              <li>Be proficient in a range of molecular, cell, tissue, physiological, microbiological and forensic laboratory and investigation techniques</li>
              <li>Develop appropriate investigative and scientific protocols to address real-world problems involving human biology and forensic investigations.</li>
              <li>Work safely in the laboratory, undertaking advanced laboratory-based investigations based on competence in techniques for physiological measurement, pharmacological assays, analytical biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, cellular physiology, microbiology and forensic processes.</li>
              <li>Operate, lead and collaborate in a team in order to solve problems of a practical (experimental) nature and to provide appropriate solutions.</li>
              <li>Apply appropriate presentation and evaluation tools to establish the significance of scientific data produced.</li>
            </ul>

              <p>This exciting course blends the study of human biology with the rigorous techniques used in forensic laboratories, including analysis of blood, fibres, fingerprints, drugs, documents, DNA and fire/explosives residue. Ideal if you are fascinated by the scientific investigation of crime.</p>
              <p>We adopt a ‘Crime Scene to Court’ approach to their teaching, which really helps you to understand forensics, in particular the need to methodically collect samples, analyse them and present the results to the standard required by the courts.</p>
              <p>You can also engage in multiple placement opportunities, the chance to conduct research alongside our experienced staff or the many professional organisations we have links with – such as Leicester Royal Infirmary, Key Forensic Services Ltd, Nemaura Pharmaceuticals Ltd and West Midlands Police.</p>
              <h3>Why choose this course?</h3>
              <p>If you are fascinated with human biology and the scientific investigation of crime, our degree will enable you to learn all about human physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology/genetics, microbiology and how each of these disciplines can be applied in forensic science.</p>
              <p>You’ll be based in our new state-of-the-art £37 million Science and Health Building, which provides an outstanding learning and research environment, which features a video-linked ‘crime scene’ house, outstanding analytical laboratory facilities and the largest Class II containment teaching laboratory in Europe, specifically designed to accommodate microbiology, cell culture, molecular biology/genetics, biochemistry and forensic science.</p>
              <p>You’ll be taught by our experienced staff, many of whom bring professional or research expertise to their teaching. They have held roles as quality assurance managers in major pharmaceuticals companies, such as GSK and British Biotech, as forensic scientists in the Forensic Science Service or as analytical scientists in government laboratories. They continue to provide consultancy and expert commentary in areas of safety and efficacy testing for the BBC, most recently on illegal skin bleaching products on sale in the UK.</p>
              <p>Coventry has an excellent reputation for evidence-based scientific research; our faculty possess expertise and have published in biochemistry, cell biology, genomic and molecular biology, microbiology, pharmacology and physiology. In your final year, you have the opportunity to collaborate on a research project, which in the past has led to students winning prizes at the Forensic Institute Research Network (FIRN) Midlands regional conference, attend the international Forensic Research and Teaching (FORREST) conference and publish articles in academic journals.</p>
              <p>Throughout your studies, you will find that the course is underpinned with practical experience. Laboratory sessions will help to develop the practical skills needed for a career in a variety of biology and forensic roles. You will learn key experimental techniques and develop essential experimental, data handling, reporting and broader scientific skills, such as literature researching, information technology, bioinformatics, data processing and the use of statistics.</p>
              <p>You’ll have the opportunity to undertake short and long-term placements. Previously students have worked on revolutionary technologies for Cambridge Scientific Solutions, such as the removal of biofilm formations which foul beer lines in pubs, or the formulation of drug products for transdermal patch applications for Nemaura Pharmaceuticals.</p>
              <p>In your final year, we tackle a simulated investigation to solve a ‘real-world’ problem, which involves the production of an expert witness statement and culminates in the presentation of evidence in a mock courtroom scenario. You could find yourself being called upon to establish whether the glass found on a suspect’s jumper indicates that he was implicated in smashing a window at an alleged burglary scene or whether blood found on he broken window matches the DNA profile of the suspect’s blood. Other scenarios include an assessment of whether the paint found on a suspect’s keys matches the paint from a damaged vehicle and an assessment of the significance of this match.</p>

              <p>If you are interested in working in the fields of human bioscience or its application to forensic science, this course will prepare you to design, implement and evaluate appropriate investigative techniques. It has been purposefully designed to give you a thorough understanding of both modern human bioscience topics and their application to forensic science. You will cover key study and research skills in the areas of forensic science, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, cell biology, microbiology and human physiology.</p>
              <p>Many areas of human bioscience, such as the development of new antimicrobials or the manipulation of stem cells to treat inherited conditions, require graduates with good theoretical and practical knowledge alongside the skills to control, implement and evaluate these new developments. This is a varied, applied course, which recognises the multidisciplinary approach that is needed in modern sciences. Throughout your degree, you will study the details of forensic science, the legal system and investigative practice, demonstrating a capability to maintain auditable records of your investigations.</p>
              <p>The first year modules will introduce you to basic scientific principles, such as hypotheses development and testing, laboratory procedures and protocols, health and safety and data presentation and analysis across the range of bioscience disciplines studied. The essential bioscience principles begin from the molecular level building up to cellular processes and extending to organism physiology systems.</p>
              <p>This process is continued throughout the second year where we develop your awareness of the structure and function of key biochemical molecules, such as DNA, RNA, proteins, enzymes and carbohydrates. You will also study the biology of cells – creation, differentiation and death; intra and inter cellular communication pathways; protein production and delivery and tissue integration.</p>
              <p>As the course progresses, you have the choice to follow themes of either human physiology or microbiology. You can develop your interest in human physiology – studying whole body systems such as cardio-pulmonary, respiratory, reproductive, neurological and/or renal systems – or follow a more microbiological route, by studying prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, viruses, phagocytes, immune responses and epidemiology. In your final year, you can continue the microbiology specialisation by extending the second year module ‘Infection and Immunity’ to the third year module ‘Medical Microbiology’. For human physiology, you would extend the second year specialist module ‘Systemic Physiology’ to the third year module ‘Clinical Physiology’.</p>
              <p>You can further customise your degree by selecting either the ‘Cancer Biology’ module or the ‘Applied Human Genetics’ module.</p>
              <p>Your main study themes are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Human Biology</strong>: Biology related to human beings, covering the disciplines of human: physiology, microbiology, molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, immunology and oncology.</li>
                <li><strong>Forensic Science</strong>: Crime scene protocols for recovery, physical, biological and chemical techniques for analysis, statistical interpretation and legal aspects governing presentation of evidence for the criminal justice system.</li>
                <li><strong>Laboratory Competence</strong>: Generic and specialised skills in experimental biology, including experimentation and measurements on humans, anti-contamination and audit trail procedures, safety (eg. key laboratory skills and competencies, good laboratory practice) and ethical considerations.</li>
                <li><strong>Research Methods</strong>: Critical analysis, reflection, information searching and experimental design in the biological sciences. Data collection, analysis and presentation.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>On completion, you will be able to:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Demonstrate understanding and knowledge of the theoretical, analytical and practical aspects and clinical applications of human physiology, biochemistry, molecular biology, microbiology, cell biology, genetics, forensic science and analytical science.</li>
                <li>Be proficient in a range of molecular, cell, tissue, physiological, microbiological and forensic laboratory and investigation techniques</li>
                <li>Develop appropriate investigative and scientific protocols to address real-world problems involving human biology and forensic investigations.</li>
                <li>Work safely in the laboratory, undertaking advanced laboratory-based investigations based on competence in techniques for physiological measurement, pharmacological assays, analytical biology, biochemistry, molecular biology, cellular physiology, microbiology and forensic processes.</li>

              <p>This degree equips students to take up roles in private sector forensic laboratory service providers or as police Crime Scene Investigators (CSIs), although further training would be required, in the form of the CSI Learning Programme at the College of Policing, Harperley Hall. Alternatively, you could pursue roles in fraud, customs and excise or as private investigators.</p>
              <p>The biological modules ensure that you can also access non-forensic careers, including pharmaceutical or food quality testing laboratories, medical and laboratory equipment sales and in more general scientific writing and/or teaching professions. This is an important element of our course design, since employment opportunities in forensics are limited and students need to be well prepared for a wide range of employment options.</p>
              <p>Previous graduates of this course have secured laboratory positions with forensic providers in both Government and private sector organisations, while others have secured posts in biology labs with companies such as The Binding Site and Severn Trent Water.</p>
              <p>Graduates not wishing to work in laboratory based occupations have previously secured posts in scientific equipment and medical sales, where they can apply their scientific training to real-world problem solving. A number have also gone on to work in managerial positions where their numeracy and analytical skills have been of benefit, for example, as a workflow planning manager for a building supplies company in Cambridgeshire or team leader of the DNA reference samples team of Key Forensic Services Ltd.</p>
